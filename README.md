## 1. What is that

 bashacks is an open source (GPL) set of bash functions
 probably useful for programmers, security analysts and general
 users that need some low level type of operations.

 In fact, there is nothing really new in bashacks since
 all functions are written using exiting software in GNU/Linux
 distributions. But you still can take advantage in use short
 commands to run tasks that commonly would require many lines
 of code to be achieved.

 There is no error handling in bashacks. That's a job
 for bash, the programs you call and yourself. :kissing_heart:

## 2. Requirements

* bash >= 4
* bc
* binutils
* coreutils
* file
* grep
* hexdump
* html2text
* perl
* sed
* wget
* zip

## 3. Installation

Use *make* command to install all scripts and config files:

```bash
sudo make install
```

That's all. You can now check the available functions from command line by typing *bh_* and pressing the tab key.

## 4. Uninstall

To uninstall, simply do:

```bash
sudo make uninstall
```

## 5. Documentation

```bash
man bashacks
```

## 6. Usage examples

What time is now in Epoch?

```bash
$ bh_epoch
1522324129
```

Alphabetically add 4 to 'f'

```bash
$ bh_charcalc f + 4
j
```

Check external IP address

```bash
$ bh_myip
177.212.113.13
```

Create a basic C program skeleton

```bash
$ bh_skel_c > hello.c
$ cat hello.c
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
//... place your header files here.

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  //... your main code goes here.

  return 0;
}
```

Calculate common checksums for a given file

```bash
$ bh_hashes /bin/ls
d77c1dd5bb8e39c2dd27c96c3fd2263e /bin/ls
e332cf8e1a78427f1368a5a0a67946ad1e7c8e28 /bin/ls
5abf61c361e5ef91582e70634dfbf2214fbdb6f29c949160b69f27ae947d919d /bin/ls
```

Find files by MIME type (ignores file extension):

```bash
$ cd /bin
$ bh_findmime -macho
[
bash
cat
```

You could pipe the results to xargs in order to calculate checksums quickly:

```bash
$ bh_findmime -pe ~/Downloads/ | xargs shasum
d9e49c4209087170e36cbef689d96240d736cf3b  /Users/menteb/Downloads/CSCWCNG.dll
50dfeea02e89f41caf52df152c7cb923c667bffc  /Users/menteb/Downloads/Receitanet-1.10.exe
86a5f89d43ab11456fb817aeceb14b83cc6c2608  /Users/menteb/Downloads/Xojo2017r3Setup.exe.opdownload
```

Convert string to hex in different output formats

```bash
$ bh_str2hex mentebinaria
6d 65 6e 74 65 62 69 6e 61 72 69 61

$ bh_str2hex -x mentebinaria
\x6d\x65\x6e\x74\x65\x62\x69\x6e\x61\x72\x69\x61

$ bh_str2hex -c mentebinaria
{ 0x6d, 0x65, 0x6e, 0x74, 0x65, 0x62, 0x69, 0x6e, 0x61, 0x72, 0x69, 0x61 }
```

There's much more. Install it and see by your own.

## 7. Knwon bugs

In some string functions you have to escape special characters because bash will try to
interpret them. See the following example using bh_strxor function:

```bash
$ bh_strxor 0x41 fernando
'$3/ /%.

$ bh_strxor 0x41 "'\$3/ /%." # string between double quotes and dollar sign escaped
fernando
```
